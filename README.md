AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category..Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.


#Insights
Flat Pricing Issue: Many hotels apply flat pricing, meaning room rates remain consistent regardless of whether itâ€™s a weekday or weekend. Adjusting prices based on demand can maximize revenue.

Occupancy and Rating Correlation: There is a correlation between occupancy rates and hotel ratings. Guests tend to cancel bookings more frequently at hotels with lower ratings. Improving customer experience and boosting ratings could reduce cancellations.

Awareness of Demand and Supply: Some hotels lack awareness of demand and supply trends, particularly during holidays. For instance, there is a notable spike in travel during summer vacations, yet many hotels fail to adjust their pricing and services accordingly. Understanding these patterns can help in optimizing revenue.
